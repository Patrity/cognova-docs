# Agents

Agents are scheduled Claude sessions that run automatically on a cron schedule. Think of them as recurring automations -- you define a prompt, set a schedule, and Cognova handles the rest.

## Agent List

When you open the Agents page, you will see:

- **Global stats cards** at the top showing aggregate metrics for the selected time period.
- A **run activity chart** showing daily success/failure counts.
- A list of **agent cards**, each displaying the agent's name, description, schedule, last run time, budget limit, and current status.

### Time Period

Use the **24h**, **7d**, or **30d** buttons in the navbar to change the time window for stats and charts. Your preference is remembered between sessions.

### Agent Status

Each agent card shows a status badge:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Running** | The agent is currently executing (with a spinning indicator). |
| **success** | The last run completed successfully. |
| **error** | The last run encountered an error. |
| **budget_exceeded** | The last run was stopped because it hit its cost limit. |
| **cancelled** | The last run was manually cancelled. |

### Quick Actions

Each agent card provides controls on the right side:

- **Enable/Disable toggle** -- Turn the agent's schedule on or off without deleting it.
- **Play button** -- Trigger an immediate manual run (only available when the agent is enabled and not already running).
- **Stop button** -- Cancel a running execution.
- **Edit button** -- Open the edit form.

Click anywhere on an agent card to navigate to its detail page.

## Creating an Agent

Click **New Agent** to open a slide-over form with the following fields:

- **Name** (required) -- A descriptive name, e.g., "Email Digest Agent."
- **Description** -- An optional summary of what the agent does.
- **Schedule** (required) -- Pick from common presets or enter a custom cron expression.
- **Prompt** (required) -- The instructions Claude will follow when the agent runs. This uses a rich-text editor with formatting support.
- **Max Turns** -- Limit how many conversational turns Claude can take per run (default: 50).
- **Max Budget (USD)** -- Set a per-run cost cap. The run will stop if the budget is exceeded.
- **Enabled** -- Whether the agent should start running on its schedule immediately.

### Schedule Presets

| Preset | Cron Expression |
|--------|----------------|
| Every 5 minutes | `*/5 * * * *` |
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` |
| Every 6 hours | `0 */6 * * *` |
| Daily at 8am | `0 8 * * *` |
| Daily at midnight | `0 0 * * *` |
| Weekly (Sunday midnight) | `0 0 * * 0` |
| Custom | You provide the expression |

## Agent Detail Page

Clicking an agent card takes you to a dedicated detail page with:

### Agent Info Card

Shows the agent's description, human-readable schedule (with the raw cron expression), budget limit, and last run time.

### Stats Cards

Metrics specific to this agent for the selected time period -- total runs, success rate, total cost, and average duration.

### Activity Chart

A bar chart of daily runs, broken down by outcome (success, error, cancelled, budget exceeded).

### Run History

A chronological list of all runs within the selected period. Each run entry shows:

- **Status badge** and timestamp.
- A truncated output or error message.
- **Duration** and **cost** on the right.

Click any run to open a modal with the full output details.

### Detail Page Actions

The navbar on the detail page provides:

- **Enable/Disable toggle**
- **Play** or **Stop** button
- **Edit** button (opens the slide-over form)
- **Delete** button (with confirmation)
- **Period selector** (24h / 7d / 30d)

Deleting an agent is permanent and also removes all of its run history. Consider disabling an agent instead if you might want to re-enable it later.
