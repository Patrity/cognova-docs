# User Guide

Cognova gives you a single interface for managing documents, tasks, conversations with Claude, scheduled agents, and more. This guide walks through each page so you know what to expect and how to get the most out of every feature.

## Pages at a Glance

| Page | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| [Dashboard](/docs/guide/dashboard) | Your home screen with at-a-glance stats and a quick capture input |
| [Documents](/docs/guide/documents) | A three-panel workspace for creating and editing files with a built-in markdown editor |
| [Tasks](/docs/guide/tasks) | Task management with filtering, projects, priorities, and due dates |
| [Chat](/docs/guide/chat) | Real-time conversations with Claude, complete with tool-use visualization |
| [Agents](/docs/guide/agents) | Cron-scheduled Claude agents that run tasks on autopilot |
| [Memories](/docs/guide/memories) | Browse and manage the knowledge chunks Claude has extracted from your conversations |

## Assistant Panel

No matter which page you are on, a floating action button in the bottom-right corner opens the **Assistant Panel**. This panel has two tabs:

- **Chat** -- A compact Claude chat interface with conversation switching, so you can ask questions without navigating away from your current work.
- **Terminal** -- A full shell session powered by xterm.js, connected over WebSocket. Run commands, use the Claude CLI, or manage your server directly.

The panel remembers whether it was open and which tab you were using between page navigations.

The Assistant Panel is hidden on the dedicated Chat page to avoid duplication, since that page already provides the full chat experience.
