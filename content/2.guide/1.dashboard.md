# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you see after logging in. It gives you a quick snapshot of what needs your attention and a shortcut for capturing ideas.

## What You Will See

The page is divided into three cards arranged in a responsive grid:

### Tasks Due Today

This card shows any tasks with a due date of today. When nothing is due, it displays a simple "No tasks due today" message. This helps you prioritize your day without opening the full [Tasks](/docs/guide/tasks) page.

### Recent Notes

A summary of your most recently edited documents. If you have not created any documents yet, it shows "No recent notes." Clicking through takes you to the [Documents](/docs/guide/documents) workspace.

### Quick Capture

A text input where you can jot down a thought or idea. This is designed for fast, low-friction capture so you never lose a fleeting thought.

## Color Mode

A color mode toggle button sits in the top-right corner of the navbar, letting you switch between light and dark themes. This toggle is available on most pages throughout the app.

The Dashboard is intentionally minimal. For deeper work, navigate to the dedicated page for each feature using the sidebar.
