# Settings

The Settings page is organized into three tabs: **Account**, **Secrets**, and **App**. Each tab manages a different aspect of your Cognova configuration.

## Account Tab

The Account tab handles your personal profile and authentication credentials.

### Profile

Update your display name. This is the name shown throughout the application and on shared documents. Enter your new name and click **Save Name**.

### Email Address

Change the email address associated with your account. Enter the new address and click **Change Email**.

### Change Password

Update your password by providing your current password, then entering and confirming your new password. All three fields are required. The passwords must match or the form will show an error.

## Secrets Tab

The Secrets tab provides an encrypted key-value store for API keys, tokens, and other sensitive values. These secrets are available to Claude skills and integrations at runtime without being exposed in your codebase.

### Viewing Secrets

Secrets are displayed in a table with three columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Key** | The secret identifier, displayed in monospace. Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` by convention (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`). |
| **Description** | An optional note explaining what the secret is for. |
| **Last Updated** | When the secret was last modified. |

Secret values are never displayed in the UI. They are stored encrypted and can only be read by server-side processes.

### Adding a Secret

Click **Add Secret** to open a modal with:

- **Key** (required) -- The identifier for the secret. Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Value** (required) -- The sensitive value, entered in a password field.
- **Description** (optional) -- A note for your future reference.

### Editing a Secret

Click the pencil icon on a secret's row to open the edit modal. The key cannot be changed, but you can update the value and description. Leave the value field empty to keep the current value unchanged.

### Deleting a Secret

Click the trash icon to delete a secret. A confirmation modal will warn you that any skills using this secret will stop working.

::doc-callout{type="warning"}
Deleting a secret is permanent. If Claude skills or agents depend on a secret, they will fail until you re-create it.

## App Tab

The App tab controls notification preferences. Cognova sends real-time toast notifications when resources are created, edited, or deleted -- either by you or by Claude on your behalf.

### Notification Preferences

The preference panel lists every resource type that can trigger notifications:

| Resource | Available Actions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Tasks** | Create, Edit, Delete, Restore |
| **Projects** | Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Agents** | Create, Edit, Delete, Run, Complete, Fail, Cancel |
| **Documents** | Edit, Delete, Restore |
| **Memories** | Create, Delete |
| **Reminders** | Create |
| **Secrets** | Create, Edit, Delete |
| **Hooks** | Create |
| **Conversations** | Delete |

Each resource has a master toggle to enable or disable all notifications for that type. Expand a resource (click the chevron) to fine-tune which specific actions trigger notifications.

For example, you might want to be notified when an agent fails but not when a memory is created.

Click **Save Preferences** to persist your changes. Notification preferences take effect immediately for the current session and are saved for future sessions.

::doc-callout{type="tip"}
If Claude agents are creating a lot of activity and the notifications are becoming noisy, use these preferences to mute the specific action types you do not need to see.
