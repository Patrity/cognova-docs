# Tasks

The Tasks page is your central hub for tracking work. It combines a filterable task list with a slide-over form for creating and editing tasks, plus a detail modal for quick viewing.

## Task List

When you open the Tasks page, you will see a navbar with:

- **Count badges** showing the total number of tasks and how many are done.
- An **Add Task** button to create a new task.
- A **toolbar** with filter controls and a search input.

The main body displays your tasks as a list. Each task shows its title, status, and relevant metadata. You can interact with tasks in several ways:

- **Click a task** to open a detail modal with the full description and metadata.
- **Toggle the checkbox** to quickly mark a task as done (or revert it back to todo).
- **Edit** a task via the edit icon to open the slide-over form.
- **Delete** a task with a confirmation prompt.

## Filtering

The toolbar provides three ways to narrow down your task list:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Status** | All Status, Todo, In Progress, Done, Blocked |
| **Project** | All Projects, or any of your active projects |
| **Search** | Free-text search across task titles and descriptions |

Filter preferences are persisted, so when you return to the Tasks page your previous status and project filters are restored automatically.

## Creating a Task

Click **Add Task** to open a slide-over form on the right side of the screen. The form includes:

- **Title** (required) -- A short summary of what needs to be done.
- **Description** -- A rich-text editor with formatting support (bold, italic, code, lists, links).
- **Status** -- Todo, In Progress, Done, or Blocked.
- **Priority** -- Low, Medium, or High.
- **Project** -- Optionally assign the task to a project.
- **Due Date** -- Set a deadline with a date picker.
- **Tags** -- Add freeform tags for categorization.

## Editing a Task

Editing uses the same slide-over form, pre-populated with the task's current values. Changes are saved when you click **Save Changes**.

## Task Details

Clicking a task in the list opens a detail modal showing all of its metadata. From the modal, you can:

- Jump to **Edit** mode.
- **Toggle** the task's completion status.
- **Close** the modal.

## Soft Delete and Restore

Deleting a task performs a soft delete. The task is hidden from the default list but can be restored. See [API Reference](/api/tasks) for details on the restore endpoint.

## Deep Linking

You can link directly to a specific task or trigger task creation via query parameters:

- `/tasks?selected=<task-id>` -- Opens the detail modal for that task.
- `/tasks?action=new` -- Immediately opens the create task form.
