# Skills

The Skills page lets you manage all Claude Code skills installed on your system. You can enable or disable skills, edit their files, create new ones from scratch, or let Claude generate them for you.

## Skills List

Navigate to **Skills** from the sidebar to see a grid of all installed skills. Each card shows:

- **Name** and **description** from the skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter
- **Version** and **author** metadata
- **Active/Inactive** status toggle
- **Core** badge for built-in skills that cannot be disabled

### Filtering

Use the search bar to filter skills by name, description, or author. Skills are sorted alphabetically by default.

## Enabling and Disabling Skills

Each skill card has a toggle switch to enable or disable it. Toggling a skill moves its directory between `~/.claude/skills/` (active) and `~/.claude/inactive-skills/` (inactive).

::doc-callout{type="info"}
Core skills (`task`, `project`, `memory`, `secret`, `environment`) cannot be disabled. Their toggle is locked.
::

## Skill Editor

Click a skill card to open the skill editor. The editor has two panels:

- **Left panel** -- File tree showing all files in the skill directory
- **Right panel** -- CodeMirror editor with syntax highlighting

The editor auto-detects language from the file extension (`.py` for Python, `.md` for Markdown, `.json` for JSON, etc.).

### File Operations

Right-click in the file tree to access the context menu:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **New File** | Create a new file in the skill directory |
| **New Folder** | Create a subdirectory |
| **Delete** | Remove a file (not available for `SKILL.md`) |

Changes are saved when you click the **Save** button or use the keyboard shortcut.

## Creating Skills

Click **Create Skill** on the Skills page to open the creation modal. You have two options:

### Blank Skill

Enter a name and description. Cognova creates a new directory with a starter `SKILL.md` file that you can edit immediately.

### AI-Generated Skill

Enter a name and description of what you want the skill to do. Claude will generate the skill files for you using the Agent SDK. Generated skills are created in `~/.claude/inactive-skills/` so you can review and enable them when ready.

::doc-callout{type="tip"}
AI-generated skills understand the Cognova API client and secrets system. Describe what you want and Claude will wire up the correct imports, API calls, and secret handling.

## Exporting Skills

Click the **download** icon in the skill editor navbar to export a skill as a `.zip` file. The zip contains the entire skill directory (excluding `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files), ready to share or contribute to the [community library](https://github.com/Patrity/cognova-skills).

## Importing Skills

Click **Import** on the Skills page to upload a `.zip` file containing a skill. The zip must include a `SKILL.md` file. Cognova validates the skill name, checks for duplicates, and installs it to `~/.claude/skills/`.

::doc-callout{type="info"}
If the zip has a root folder, the folder name is used as the skill name. Otherwise the zip filename is used.

## Renaming Skills

Click the rename icon in the skill editor navbar to rename a skill. This renames both the directory and the `name` field in `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

## Community Library

Click the **Library** button on the Skills page to browse community-contributed skills. See [Community Library](/claude/community-library) for details.
