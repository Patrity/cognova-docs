# Memories

The Memories page lets you browse, search, and manage the knowledge that Claude has extracted from your conversations. These memory chunks are what give Claude long-term context about your preferences, decisions, and established patterns.

## How Memories Are Created

Memories are not created manually. They are automatically extracted from your Claude conversations when extraction hooks are triggered. Each chunk captures a distinct piece of knowledge -- a decision you made, a fact you shared, a solution that worked, or a pattern Claude noticed.

For details on how extraction works, see [Claude Integration](/docs/claude).

## Memory Table

The page displays memories in a data table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Type** | The category of knowledge, shown as a color-coded badge with an icon. |
| **Content** | The extracted text, truncated to two lines. Hover to see the full content. |
| **Relevance** | A visual progress bar showing how relevant this memory is (0-100%). |
| **Accessed** | How many times this memory has been retrieved for context. |
| **Created** | When the memory was extracted, shown as relative time (e.g., "3 days ago"). |

## Memory Types

Each memory is classified into one of six types:

| Type | Icon | Color | What It Captures |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Decision** | Branch | Primary | Choices you made and their reasoning |
| **Fact** | Info | Blue | Concrete facts about you, your projects, or your environment |
| **Solution** | Check | Green | Approaches that successfully solved a problem |
| **Pattern** | Repeat | Yellow | Recurring workflows or conventions you follow |
| **Preference** | Settings | Neutral | Your stated likes, dislikes, and style preferences |
| **Summary** | File | Neutral | Condensed summaries of longer exchanges |

## Filtering and Search

Use the toolbar to narrow down the memory list:

- **Type filter** -- Select a specific memory type or "All Types" from the dropdown.
- **Search** -- Free-text search across memory content. Results update as you type with a short debounce delay.

## Relevance Scores

Each memory has a relevance score between 0 and 1. Higher scores mean the memory is considered more important or more frequently useful. The score is displayed as both a progress bar and a percentage value, making it easy to spot the most impactful memories at a glance.

## Access Counts

The "Accessed" column shows how many times a memory has been retrieved when building context for Claude. Frequently accessed memories are the ones Claude relies on most.

## Deleting Memories

To delete a memory, click the three-dot menu on its row and select **Delete**. A confirmation modal will appear. Deletion is permanent -- the memory cannot be restored.

::doc-callout{type="info"}
The total count of memories is displayed as a badge next to the page title, so you can see at a glance how large your memory store is.
::

::doc-callout{type="tip"}
If Claude keeps recalling something you would rather it forget, find that memory here and delete it. Claude will no longer use it as context.
