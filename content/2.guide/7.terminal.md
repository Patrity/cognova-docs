# Terminal

Cognova includes an embedded terminal that gives you shell access to your server directly from the browser. It lives inside the **Assistant Panel** -- a floating widget available on every page except the dedicated Chat page.

## Opening the Assistant Panel

Click the chat bubble button in the bottom-right corner of any page. The panel opens with two tabs:

- **Chat** -- A compact Claude conversation interface (see [Chat](/docs/guide/chat) for the full-page version).
- **Terminal** -- A full interactive shell session.

Click the tab to switch. The panel remembers which tab you were last using.

## Terminal Features

The terminal is powered by [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) and connects to your server over a WebSocket. It provides:

- **Full shell access** -- Run any command available on your server, just as you would in a local terminal.
- **Proper terminal rendering** -- Colors, cursor positioning, scrollback, and clickable links all work as expected.
- **Resizable panel** -- The Assistant Panel can be resized by dragging its edges. The terminal automatically adjusts to fit the available space.
- **Keyboard input** -- Standard terminal key bindings work, including arrow keys, Tab completion, and Ctrl+C to interrupt processes.

## Connection Status

A status indicator at the top of the terminal tab shows the current connection state:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected** (green wifi icon) | The WebSocket is active and the shell is ready. |
| **Connecting...** (spinning icon) | The client is establishing the connection. |
| **Disconnected** (grey wifi icon) | The connection was lost. |
| **Connection error** (grey wifi icon) | A connection attempt failed. |

If the connection drops, click the **Reconnect** button to re-establish it. The client will also attempt automatic reconnection up to 5 times with increasing delays.

## Using the Claude CLI

Because the terminal provides full shell access, you can use the Claude CLI (`claude`) directly. This is useful for:

- Running Claude Code commands against your codebase.
- Executing one-off prompts from the command line.
- Managing your Claude configuration files.

For more on Claude CLI integration, see [Claude Integration](/docs/claude).

## Chat Tab

The Chat tab in the Assistant Panel is a lightweight version of the full [Chat](/docs/guide/chat) page. It includes:

- A **conversation selector** dropdown to switch between existing conversations.
- A **new conversation** button.
- The same message streaming and tool-use visualization as the full Chat page.
- Persistent state -- the last conversation you were viewing is remembered.

The Assistant Panel is great for quick questions or running a command without losing your place. For longer conversations, use the dedicated [Chat](/docs/guide/chat) page which provides more screen real estate.
