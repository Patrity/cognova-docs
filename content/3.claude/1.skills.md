## What Are Skills?

Skills are slash commands that Claude can run during a conversation. Each skill is either a Python script that calls the Cognova API or a pure instruction file that guides Claude's behavior. When you type `/task create "Fix login bug"`, Claude executes the task skill's Python script, which sends a POST request to the Cognova API.

Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/` and are registered automatically by Claude Code. You can manage them from the [Skills page](/docs/guide/skills) in the dashboard.

## /task -- Task Management

Create, list, update, complete, and delete tasks.

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create <title>` | Create a new task |
| `list` | List tasks with optional filters |
| `update <id>` | Update task fields |
| `done <id_or_search>` | Mark a task as complete |
| `delete <id>` | Soft-delete a task |

### Flags

**create:**
- `--project, -p` -- Associate with a project (by name, fuzzy matched)
- `--priority, -P` -- Priority level: `1` (low), `2` (medium), `3` (high)
- `--due, -d` -- Due date (`today`, `tomorrow`, `next week`, day name, or `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `--tags, -t` -- Comma-separated tags
- `--description` -- Longer description text

**list:**
- `--status, -s` -- Filter by `todo`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked`
- `--project, -p` -- Filter by project name
- `--search, -q` -- Search title and description
- `--due` -- Filter by `today`, `week`, or `overdue`

**update:** Accepts `--title`, `--description`, `--status`, `--priority`, `--due`, `--tags`, `--project`

### Examples

```
/task create "Deploy staging environment" --project homelab --priority 3 --due friday
/task list --status todo --due week
/task done "staging"
```

The `done` command accepts either a task ID prefix or a title search. If the search matches a single incomplete task, it completes it. If multiple match, it shows options.

::doc-callout{type="info"}
Task IDs use UUID prefixes. You only need the first few characters to identify a task (e.g., `a3df` instead of the full UUID).
::

## /project -- Project Management

Organize tasks into projects with names and colors.

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `search <query>` | Find projects by name |
| `list` | List all projects |
| `create <name> --color <hex>` | Create a new project |
| `update <id>` | Update project fields |
| `delete <id>` | Soft-delete a project |

### Flags

**create:**
- `--color, -c` (required) -- Hex color code (e.g., `#3b82f6`)
- `--description, -d` -- Project description

**update:** Accepts `--name`, `--color`, `--description`

### Examples

```
/project create "Homelab" --color #10b981 --description "Self-hosted infrastructure"
/project search home
/project list
```

::doc-callout{type="tip"}
The create command checks for duplicate names before creating. If a project with a similar name exists, it warns you and suggests using the existing one.
::

## /memory -- Memory Management

Search, store, and inspect the persistent memory system.

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `search <query>` | Search memories by content |
| `recent [limit]` | Get the most recent memories |
| `store <content>` | Manually store a memory |
| `decisions` | List all decision-type memories |
| `about <topic>` | Find everything known about a topic |
| `context` | Preview what context would be injected into a session |

### Flags

**search / recent / decisions:**
- `--type, -t` -- Filter by `decision`, `fact`, `solution`, `pattern`, `preference`, `summary`
- `--project, -p` -- Filter by project path
- `--limit, -l` -- Max results (default: 10-20)

**store:**
- `--type, -t` -- Memory type (default: `fact`)
- `--project, -p` -- Associated project path
- `--relevance, -r` -- Relevance score 0-1 (default: `0.9`)

### Examples

```
/memory about "deployment"
/memory store --type decision "Using Caddy instead of Nginx for reverse proxy"
/memory search "database" --type solution
/memory decisions --project homelab
```

Claude is instructed to use `/memory` proactively. Before starting work, it checks what it already knows. After completing work, it stores outcomes and decisions. See [Memory System](/docs/claude/memory-system) for how this works under the hood.

## /environment -- System Health

Inspect the Cognova installation, check service status, and troubleshoot issues.

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `info` | Show system details (OS, Node, Python, disk, vault stats) |
| `status` | Check PM2 process status, memory usage, API health |
| `logs [--lines N]` | Show recent PM2 log output (default: 30 lines) |
| `health` | Run a full API health check across all endpoints |

### Examples

```
/environment status
/environment health
/environment logs --lines 50
```

The `health` subcommand tests five API endpoints (health, tasks, projects, documents, memory) and reports response times for each. This is the fastest way to diagnose whether the Cognova server is running correctly.

```
=== API Health Check ===

Base URL: http://localhost:3000

  OK    Health            12ms
  OK    Tasks             45ms
  OK    Projects          38ms
  OK    Documents         52ms
  OK    Memory            41ms

Overall: All healthy
```

## /secret -- Secrets Management

Manage encrypted secrets for API keys, tokens, and credentials. Use this when you need to store, retrieve, or manage sensitive values that skills and agents access at runtime.

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list` | List all stored secrets with descriptions |
| `get <KEY>` | Retrieve a decrypted secret value |
| `set <KEY>` | Store a new secret or update an existing one |
| `delete <KEY>` | Delete a secret permanently |

### Flags

**set:**
- `--value, -v` -- The secret value to store
- `--description, -d` -- A note explaining what this secret is for

### Examples

```
/secret list
/secret set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL --value "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." --description "Weekly digest webhook"
/secret get DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
/secret delete OLD_API_KEY
```

Secrets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest and can only be decrypted server-side. They are also accessible through the **Settings > Secrets** tab in the dashboard.

::doc-callout{type="warning"}
Never hardcode API keys or tokens in skill scripts. Always use `/secret set` to store credentials, then use `get_secret()` in Python scripts to retrieve them at runtime.
::

## /skill-creator -- Build New Skills

An interactive wizard that helps you design and create custom Claude Code skills.

Unlike the other skills, `/skill-creator` is a pure instruction skill -- it has no Python script. Instead, it provides Claude with a structured process for gathering requirements, checking for existing solutions, and generating the right skill files.

### What It Does

1. **Gathers requirements** -- asks what the skill should do, who invokes it, and whether it needs external APIs
2. **Searches for existing solutions** -- checks for MCPs, plugins, and community tools before building from scratch
3. **Determines skill type** -- pure instruction, Python script, or subagent
4. **Generates the files** -- creates `SKILL.md` and optionally a Python script with proper structure
5. **Handles secrets** -- shows how to use the Cognova secrets store instead of hardcoding API keys

### Example

```
You: /skill-creator
Claude: What kind of skill would you like to create?
You: I want a skill that sends a summary of my completed tasks to Discord every week
Claude: Let me check if there's an existing MCP for Discord webhooks...
       [searches, finds options, suggests approach]
       I'll create a Python script skill that uses the Cognova API
       for tasks and a Discord webhook for delivery. Let me set that up.
```
