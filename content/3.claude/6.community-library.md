# Community Skills Library

The Community Library lets you browse, install, and update skills contributed by other Cognova users. Skills are hosted in the [cognova-skills](https://github.com/Patrity/cognova-skills) GitHub repository and synced automatically to your instance.

## How It Works

1. The `cognova-skills` repository contains a `registry.json` file that lists all available skills
2. Cognova syncs this registry on startup and every 30 minutes
3. The Library page shows all available skills with their install status
4. Installing a skill downloads its files from GitHub and writes them to `~/.claude/skills/`

## Browsing the Library

Navigate to **Skills > Library** from the dashboard. Each skill card shows:

- **Name** and **description**
- **Tags** for filtering (e.g., `official`, `community`, `diagnostics`, `automation`)
- **Version** and **author**
- **Required secrets** -- API keys the skill needs to function
- **Install** / **Update** / **Installed** status
- **View** link to inspect the source on GitHub

### Tag Filtering

Click any tag to filter the grid to only skills with that tag. Click again to clear the filter. Tags are combined with the search bar for more specific results.

### Tags System

Every skill must have between 1 and 5 tags. The first tag must be either `community` or `official`:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `official` | Maintained by the Cognova team |
| `community` | Contributed by the community |

Authors can add up to 4 additional free-form tags for categorization (e.g., `discord`, `webhooks`, `automation`, `diagnostics`).

## Installing a Skill

Click the **Install** button on a skill card. Cognova will:

1. Fetch each file from the GitHub repository
2. Write the files to `~/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/`
3. Inject `installed-from: "cognova-skills"` into the skill's frontmatter

The skill is immediately available as a slash command.

## Updating Skills

When a newer version is available in the registry, the card shows an **Update available** badge and an **Update** button. Clicking it replaces the local files with the latest version from the registry.

## Required Secrets

Some skills need API keys or tokens to function. These are listed on the skill card as "Requires: KEY_NAME". Before installing, make sure you have the required secrets configured in **Settings > Secrets** or via the `/secret set` command.

## Contributing Skills

Anyone can contribute skills to the community library. See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/Patrity/cognova-skills/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for requirements:

- Create a directory with a `SKILL.md` file (and optional Python scripts)
- Include required frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `tags`
- Never hardcode secrets -- use `get_secret()` from the shared API client
- Submit a pull request to the `cognova-skills` repository

CI automatically validates frontmatter, scans for hardcoded secrets, and updates `registry.json` on merge.
