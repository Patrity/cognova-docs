## What is Cognova?

Cognova is a self-hosted knowledge management system powered by Claude Code. It gives you a personal AI agent that can manage tasks, organize notes, and execute commands on your machine through a web dashboard.

Key capabilities:

- **Task & project management** -- create, track, and complete tasks with AI assistance
- **Vault** -- a markdown-based knowledge base organized with the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)
- **Embedded terminal** -- Claude Code runs directly on your server, with full shell access
- **Memory system** -- the agent remembers decisions, preferences, and context across sessions
- **Customizable personality** -- configure the agent's name, tone, and behavior during setup

Cognova is a Nuxt 4 application backed by PostgreSQL and managed by PM2.

::doc-callout{type="warning"}
Cognova gives an AI agent unrestricted access to the machine it runs on. Always install on a dedicated VM or container -- never on a personal machine with sensitive data.

## Quick Start

Run the one-line installer to set up everything automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cognova.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The installer detects your platform (macOS, Linux, or WSL), installs any missing prerequisites (Node.js 22+, Python 3, pnpm), then launches the interactive setup wizard.

Or install manually via npm:

```bash
npm install -g cognova
cognova init
```

The `init` wizard walks you through:

1. Prerequisite checks (Node >= 22, Python 3, pnpm)
2. Agent personality configuration
3. Install directory and vault location
4. Database setup (local or remote PostgreSQL)
5. Network access and admin credentials

Once complete, open `http://localhost:3000` and log in with the credentials you chose.
