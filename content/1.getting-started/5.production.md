Cognova gives an AI agent unrestricted access to the machine it runs on. Before exposing it to any network, work through this checklist.

## Security

### Use a Dedicated Machine

Never run Cognova on a personal computer or alongside sensitive workloads. Use a dedicated:

- Virtual machine (e.g., a VPS from Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Linode)
- Docker container with limited host access
- Isolated cloud instance

The embedded terminal and Claude Code CLI can read, write, and execute anything the process user has access to.

### Put a Reverse Proxy with TLS in Front

Never expose port 3000 directly to the internet. Use a reverse proxy:

**Caddy (automatic HTTPS):**

```
cognova.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

**Nginx:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name cognova.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/cognova.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/cognova.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

The `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers are required for WebSocket support (terminal and chat features).

### Change Default Credentials

If you skipped setting credentials during `cognova init`, the defaults are `admin@example.com` / `changeme123`. Change them immediately.

### Generate a Strong Auth Secret

The `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` signs session tokens. Use a cryptographically random value:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

See the [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) reference for all security-related variables.

### Restrict Network Access

Use firewall rules to limit who can reach the app:

```bash
# UFW example: allow only your IP
sudo ufw allow from YOUR_IP to any port 443
sudo ufw deny 3000
```

### Do Not Store Secrets on the Machine

Avoid placing SSH keys, cloud credentials, API keys, or production secrets on the Cognova host. The agent has full file system access and could inadvertently read or expose them.

## Operations

### Configure Swap (Small VMs)

Nuxt builds can exhaust memory on VMs with less than 4 GB RAM. Add swap:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### PM2 Log Management

PM2 logs grow unbounded by default. Install the log rotation module:

```bash
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:max_size 50M
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:retain 7
```

Logs are stored in `<install-dir>/logs/`.

### PM2 Startup on Boot

Ensure Cognova restarts after a server reboot:

```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Monitor Resources

```bash
pm2 monit          # Real-time CPU/memory
pm2 logs cognova   # Tail logs
```

### Database Backups

For local PostgreSQL (Docker):

```bash
docker exec cognova-db pg_dump -U postgres cognova > backup.sql
```

For hosted databases (Neon, Supabase), use the provider's backup features.

### Health Endpoint

The app exposes `GET /api/health` which returns:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": { "available": true }
}
```

Use this for uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot, Healthchecks.io).

## Pre-Launch Checklist

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Dedicated VM or container | |
| Reverse proxy with TLS configured | |

| Default admin credentials changed | |
| Firewall restricts access to trusted IPs | |
| No SSH keys or cloud creds on the host | |
| Swap configured (if < 4 GB RAM) | |
| PM2 log rotation installed | |
| PM2 startup hook configured | |
| Database backups scheduled | |
| Health endpoint monitored | |
| `cognova doctor` reports all checks passing | |
