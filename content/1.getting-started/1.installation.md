## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version | Required | Notes |
|------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Node.js | >= 22 | Yes | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| Python 3 | Any | Yes | Used by skills and hooks |
| pnpm | Any | Yes | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| Docker | Any | No | Only needed for local PostgreSQL |
| Claude Code CLI | Any | No | Installed during init if missing |

The `cognova init` wizard checks all of these automatically and will exit with instructions if a required dependency is missing.

## Install

Install Cognova globally from npm:

```bash
npm install -g cognova
```

Then run the setup wizard:

```bash
cognova init
```

## What the Wizard Does

The wizard is interactive and handles the full setup in sequence:

### 1. Prerequisite Check

Validates Node.js, Python 3, and pnpm versions. Offers to install Claude Code CLI if missing.

### 2. Agent Personality

Configures your agent's identity:

- **Name** -- what the agent is called (default: `Cognova`)
- **Your name** -- how the agent addresses you
- **Tone** -- concise, casual, formal, or custom
- **Traits** -- proactive, opinionated, cautious, curious, organized
- **Communication style** -- bullets, narrative, or mixed
- **Proactivity** -- reactive, balanced, or proactive

### 3. Install Directory

Choose where Cognova files are stored. Default: `~/cognova`.

The wizard copies the application source (app, server, shared, build output) to this directory.

### 4. Vault Location

Choose where your markdown knowledge base lives. Default: `~/vault`.

If the directory does not exist, the wizard creates it with the PARA folder structure:

```
vault/
  inbox/        # Quick captures
  areas/        # Ongoing responsibilities
  projects/     # Active work with deadlines
  resources/    # Reference material
  archive/      # Completed or inactive items
```

### 5. Database

Choose one of:

- **Local PostgreSQL** -- spins up a `postgres:16-alpine` Docker container on port 5432. Requires Docker.
- **Remote PostgreSQL** -- paste a connection string from Neon, Supabase, or any hosted provider.

### 6. Network Access

Select how you will access the web UI:

| Option | Binds to | Use case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Local only | `localhost:3000` | Same machine |
| Specific IP/domain | `0.0.0.0:3000` | LAN or reverse proxy |
| Any connection | `0.0.0.0:3000` | Open access (not recommended without TLS) |

::doc-callout{type="warning"}
Cognova gives Claude Code unrestricted shell access. If exposed to a network, always put a reverse proxy with TLS in front. See the [production checklist](/self-hosting/production).

### 7. Admin Credentials

Set your email, password (minimum 8 characters), and display name. These seed the database on first startup.

### 8. Install & Launch

The wizard:

1. Generates `.env` from your answers
2. Installs Claude Code config to `~/.claude/` (CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, rules, settings.json)
3. Runs `pnpm install`
4. Installs PM2 (if not present)
5. Starts the app via PM2
6. Runs a health check against `http://localhost:3000/api/health`

When the wizard completes, open the URL shown in the summary and log in.

## After Installation

Manage Cognova with the CLI:

```bash
cognova start      # Start the app
cognova stop       # Stop the app
cognova restart    # Restart the app
cognova update     # Update to latest version
cognova doctor     # Run health checks
cognova reset      # Re-generate Claude config
```
