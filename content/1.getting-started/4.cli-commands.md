The Cognova CLI manages the lifecycle of your installation. All commands operate on the install directory chosen during `cognova init`.

## Command Reference

### `cognova init`

Interactive setup wizard. Creates the install directory, generates configuration, sets up the database, installs dependencies, and starts the app as a system service.

```bash
cognova init
```

The wizard steps are covered in detail in [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation).

### `cognova start`

Starts the system service (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux).

```bash
cognova start
```

Requires the service config to exist (created by `init`). You can also start manually:

```bash
cd ~/cognova && node .output/server/index.mjs
```

### `cognova stop`

Stops the system service.

```bash
cognova stop
```

### `cognova restart`

Restarts the system service. Use after editing `.env` or other configuration.

```bash
cognova restart
```

### `cognova update`

Checks for a newer version on npm, downloads it, updates source files, runs migrations, and restarts.

```bash
cognova update
```

What it does:

1. Checks `npm view cognova version` against the installed version
2. Creates a backup of current source files (`.update-backup/`)
3. Downloads and extracts the new package
4. Copies updated source files (preserves `.env`, `.api-token`, `node_modules`, `logs`)
5. Syncs Claude config (skills, hooks, rules) to `~/.claude/`
6. Runs `pnpm install` and `pnpm db:migrate`
7. Restarts the system service

If any step fails, the update automatically rolls back to the backup.

After updating, run `cognova reset` if you want to regenerate `CLAUDE.md` or `settings.json` with any new defaults from the update.

### `cognova doctor`

Runs a comprehensive health check across your installation.

```bash
cognova doctor
```

Checks performed:

| Check | What it validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| `.env` file | Exists in install directory |
| `node_modules` | Dependencies installed |
| Build output | `.output/server/index.mjs` exists |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Agent identity file |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Skills directory |
| `~/.claude/hooks/` | Hooks directory |
| `~/.claude/rules/` | Rules directory |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude settings |
| Claude Code CLI | `claude --version` succeeds |
| Python 3 | `python3 --version` succeeds |
| System service | Service is running (launchd/systemd) |
| Health endpoint | `GET /api/health` returns `ok` |
| Database | Health endpoint reports database available |
| Vault directory | Path from metadata exists |
| Version | Matches latest on npm |

Each check reports PASS, FAIL, or WARN.

### `cognova reset`

Re-generates Claude Code configuration files. Use when you want to update your agent personality or restore config files to defaults.

```bash
cognova reset
```

Presents a multi-select menu:

| Option | What it resets |
|--------|---------------|
| CLAUDE.md | Re-runs personality prompts, regenerates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| Skills | Re-copies skills to `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Hooks | Re-copies hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/` |
| Rules | Re-copies rules to `~/.claude/rules/` |
| Settings | Re-generates `~/.claude/settings.json` |

::doc-callout{type="info"}
`cognova update` syncs skills, hooks, and rules automatically. Use `reset` only for CLAUDE.md/settings regeneration or manual config recovery.
::

## How the CLI Finds Your Installation

The CLI locates your install directory by checking:

1. A `.cognova` metadata file in the current working directory
2. A `.cognova` metadata file in your home directory (`~/.cognova`)

The metadata file is written by `cognova init` and contains the install path, vault path, version, and timestamps.
