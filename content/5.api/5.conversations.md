Conversations are chat sessions between you and the Claude agent. They are created automatically when you send a message through the chat WebSocket. The API provides read-only access to conversation history -- new conversations are initiated through the [WebSocket protocol](/api/websocket), not the REST API.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/conversations` | List recent conversations |
| GET | `/api/conversations/:id` | Get a conversation with messages |
| DELETE | `/api/conversations/:id` | Delete a conversation |

All endpoints require authentication.

| `tool_use` | `id`, `name`, `input` | Tool invocation by the assistant |
