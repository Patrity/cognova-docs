# Skills API

Endpoints for managing skills installed at `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/inactive-skills/`, plus the community library catalog.

## List Skills

```
GET /api/skills
```

Returns all installed skills (both active and inactive), with metadata parsed from each skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "task",
      "description": "Manage Cognova tasks",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": "Cognova",
      "active": true,
      "core": true,
      "allowedTools": ["Bash", "Read"],
      "requiresSecrets": [],
      "installedFrom": "",
      "fileCount": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## Get Skill Detail

```
GET /api/skills/:name
```

Returns full metadata and file tree for a single skill.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "task",
    "description": "Manage Cognova tasks",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Cognova",
    "active": true,
    "core": true,
    "meta": { "...full frontmatter..." },
    "files": [
      { "name": "SKILL.md", "path": "SKILL.md", "type": "file" },
      { "name": "task.py", "path": "task.py", "type": "file" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Toggle Skill

```
POST /api/skills/:name/toggle
```

Moves a skill between `~/.claude/skills/` (active) and `~/.claude/inactive-skills/` (inactive). Core skills cannot be toggled.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": { "name": "my-skill", "active": false }
}
```

## Rename Skill

```
POST /api/skills/:name/rename
```

Renames a skill directory and updates the `name` field in `SKILL.md`.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "newName": "new-skill-name"
}
```

## Create Skill

```
POST /api/skills/create
```

Creates a blank skill with a starter `SKILL.md`.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "my-new-skill",
  "description": "What this skill does"
}
```

## Generate Skill

```
POST /api/skills/generate
```

Uses the Claude Agent SDK to generate a skill based on a description. The skill is created in `~/.claude/inactive-skills/` for review before activation.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "discord-webhook",
  "description": "Send a message to a Discord webhook URL"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "discord-webhook",
    "path": "/home/user/.claude/inactive-skills/discord-webhook"
  }
}
```

::doc-callout{type="info"}
Skill generation costs are tracked in the token usage system under the source `agent` with source name `Skill Generator`.
::

## Export Skill

```
GET /api/skills/:name/export
```

Downloads the skill directory as a `.zip` file. The response has `Content-Type: application/zip` and `Content-Disposition: attachment` headers, so the browser triggers a file download.

The archive excludes `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files.

## Import Skill

```
POST /api/skills/import
```

Uploads a `.zip` file to install a new skill. Uses `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field.

### Validation

- Zip must contain a `SKILL.md` file
- Skill name is derived from the root folder in the zip (or the filename)
- Skill name must pass `validateSkillName()` rules
- Skill must not already exist (active or inactive)
- All zip entries are checked for path traversal

### Response

```json
{
  "data": { "name": "my-skill", "fileCount": 3 }
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `400` | No file uploaded, empty zip, missing SKILL.md, invalid name, path traversal |
| `409` | Skill with that name already exists |
